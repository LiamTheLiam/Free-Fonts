# Document Fonts

Fonts that start with [FREE] are free for commercial use. Fonts that don't start with [FREE] are not free for commercial use and you must purchase a license for commercial use.

## 1. Times and Helvetica

Times and Helvetica are both extremely popular fonts that go well together. The free metrically compatible version is Nimbus Roman (No 9L) and Nimbus Sans (L).

## 2. Times New Roman and Arial

Also an extremely popular font pair. Both of these fonts are slightly newer than Times and Helvetica and are both great choices. The free metrically compatible alternative is Tinos + Arimo (Liberation Serif and Liberation Sans are also compatible and are based on Tinos & Arimo).

## 3. Cambria + Calibri

Cambria and Calibri are much more modern fonts than Times, Helvetica, TNR, and Arial. They are the default serif and sans fonts in Microsoft Word, and I like them a lot. The free alternative is Caladea + Carlito.

## 4. Baskerville

I couldn't pair this font with a sans font since it doesn't have one, but I added it because I like Baskerville a lot and use it in my academic work. The free alternative is Libre Baskerville *BUT* it is not metrically compatible (the same size) which means that changing a document using Baskerville to Libre Baskerville may change formatting.
