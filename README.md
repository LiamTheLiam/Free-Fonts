# Free Fonts

## Important for Windows users!

Some of the included fonts cannot be installed in Windows as they are since they are .ttc (TrueType Collection, which is a file that contains multiple font files in one). If you want to install these fonts you have to extract them from their collections into individual files. You can do that using [this site](https://transfonter.org/ttc-unpack).

## About

This repository consists of **540** files with many popular fonts all provided for free.

This repository also contains fonts that would cost a lot of money if you had to pay for them yourself. (e.g., *Times New Roman*)

The fonts were retrieved from my M1 Macbook Air. Every common and neccessary font is here, plus some additional ones I downloaded (Noto Fonts, Liberation Fonts, Roboto, etc.).

### The purpose of this

I thought it would be useful to be able for anyone to easily access fonts they need. For example, Windows does not come with Helvetica Nueue, but OS X does!

Another OS X font that is made by Apple is San Francisco, which I like. You normally cannot get this font on Windows.

### Other uses

You could also use these fonts for web development. If you are hosting a website and need some fonts for your site you can use any of these!

Another use of these fonts is if you are using Linux. Most Linux distros come without many fonts, and you may be lacking some neccessary fonts (Times New Roman, Arial, etc.).
